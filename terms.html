<h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

<p>This CTBids Seller Image Helper Chrome Extension ("the Extension") is provided to you free of charge. By using this Extension, you agree to these terms and conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The Extension is designed to assist CTBids managers by scraping auction photo URLs from https://seller.ctbids/dashboard and queuing them for download, naming the files according to the auction item titles.</p>

<p><strong>No Warranty:</strong> THE EXTENSION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE EXTENSION WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR MEET YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.</p>

<p><strong>Use at Your Own Risk:</strong> YOU USE THIS EXTENSION ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR ISSUES ARISING FROM ITS USE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DATA LOSS, SYSTEM CRASHES, OR ANY VIOLATION OF CTBIDS' TERMS OF SERVICE. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND CTBIDS' POLICIES.</p>

<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Extension at any time without notice.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Your privacy is important to us.</p>

<p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> The Extension operates locally within your browser. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, browsing history, or information from your CTBids account or dashboard to us or any third party. All scraping and download queuing processes occur entirely on your local machine.</p>

<p><strong>Information Scraped:</strong> The Extension only accesses and processes publicly available image URLs and item titles from the https://seller.ctbids/dashboard page you are actively viewing to facilitate the stated photo download functionality. This information is not stored permanently by the Extension after the download queue is generated.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to this Policy:</strong> We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here.</p>
